# Testing Your Integration

Before going live with your Notch Pay integration, it's important to thoroughly test it to ensure everything works as expected. Notch Pay provides a dedicated test environment and tools to help you simulate various payment scenarios without processing real transactions.

## Test Environment

Notch Pay offers a sandbox environment that mirrors the production environment but doesn't process real money. This allows you to:

- Test the full payment flow
- Simulate successful and failed payments
- Test webhooks and callbacks
- Verify your integration logic

## Accessing Test Mode

To access test mode:

1. Log in to your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co)
2. Click on the environment selector in the top navigation bar
3. Select "Test Mode"

When in test mode, the dashboard will display a "TEST MODE" indicator to remind you that you're not in the production environment.

## Test API Keys

In test mode, you'll use test API keys that start with `test_`. These keys are different from your live API keys and can only be used in the test environment.

To find your test API keys:

1. Go to your dashboard in test mode
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Copy your test API key

```
test_sk_123456789
```

## Test Payment Methods

Notch Pay provides several test payment methods that you can use to simulate different payment scenarios.

### Mobile Money Test Accounts

You can use the following test mobile money accounts:

| Provider | Phone Number | Result |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| MTN Mobile Money | +237670000000 | Success |
| MTN Mobile Money | +237670000001 | Insufficient funds |
| MTN Mobile Money | +237670000002 | Failed (other reason) |
| Orange Money | +237690000000 | Success |
| Orange Money | +237690000001 | Insufficient funds |
| Orange Money | +237690000002 | Failed (other reason) |

### Test Cards

You can use the following test cards for card payments:

| Card Type | Card Number | Expiry | CVV | Result |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----|--------|
| Visa | 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Any future date | Any 3 digits | Success |
| Mastercard | 5555 5555 5555 4444 | Any future date | Any 3 digits | Success |
| Visa | 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Any future date | Any 3 digits | Declined (insufficient funds) |
| Visa | 4000 0000 0000 0009 | Any future date | Any 3 digits | Declined (fraud) |
| Visa | 4000 0000 0000 0127 | Any future date | Any 3 digits | Declined (incorrect CVV) |

For a complete list of test cards and their behaviors, see [Test Cards](/docs/testing/test-cards).

## Testing Webhooks

To test webhooks in your local development environment:

1. Use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) to expose your local server to the internet
2. Register the temporary URL as a webhook endpoint in your Notch Pay dashboard (in test mode)
3. Trigger events (e.g., create a test payment) to generate webhook notifications
4. Check your logs to ensure your application is receiving and processing the webhooks correctly

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Successful Payment

1. Create a payment using your test API key
2. Use a test payment method that's configured to succeed
3. Verify that your application handles the successful payment correctly
4. Check that webhooks and callbacks are processed correctly

### Failed Payment

1. Create a payment using your test API key
2. Use a test payment method that's configured to fail
3. Verify that your application handles the failed payment correctly
4. Check that error messages are displayed appropriately to users

### Canceled Payment

1. Create a payment using your test API key
2. Cancel the payment before it's completed
3. Verify that your application handles the canceled payment correctly

### Expired Payment

1. Create a payment using your test API key with a short expiration time
2. Let the payment expire without completing it
3. Verify that your application handles the expired payment correctly

## Testing Transfers

To test money transfers:

1. Add funds to your test account (this is simulated in test mode)
2. Create a beneficiary using test data
3. Initiate a transfer to the beneficiary
4. Verify that your application handles the transfer correctly

## Common Testing Issues

### Webhook Verification Failures

If webhook verification fails in test mode, ensure that:

- You're using the correct webhook secret for the test environment
- Your webhook endpoint is accessible from the internet
- Your server is responding with a 2xx status code

### API Key Confusion

Make sure you're using test API keys for test mode and live API keys for production. Using the wrong key will result in authentication errors.

### Missing Test Data

If you're not seeing test data in your dashboard, ensure that you're in test mode. Test and live data are completely separate.

## Going Live

Once you've thoroughly tested your integration and are confident that it works correctly, you can switch to live mode and start accepting real payments.

Before going live, make sure to:

1. Switch to live mode in your dashboard
2. Update your integration to use your live API keys
3. Update webhook endpoints to your production URLs
4. Perform a final test with a small real payment
