# Managing Beneficiaries

This guide explains how to manage your beneficiaries in Notch Pay, including viewing, editing, and deleting beneficiaries.

## Viewing Beneficiaries

2. Navigate to the "Transfers" section
3. Click on "Beneficiaries" to see a list of all your beneficiaries
4. Use the search and filter options to find specific beneficiaries

### Using the API

You can retrieve a list of beneficiaries using the [Beneficiaries API](/api-reference/beneficiaries):

### Using the API

To update a beneficiary, you can use the PUT method:

PUT https://api.notchpay.co/beneficiaries/{id}
```

Request body:

  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "johnsmith@example.com",
  "phone": "+237600000001"
}
```

```json
{
  "status": "Accepted",

  "beneficiary": {
    "id": "ben_123456789",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "johnsmith@example.com",

```

## Best Practices for Managing Beneficiaries

1. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review your beneficiaries list to remove outdated entries
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names for beneficiaries to easily identify them
3. **Verification**: Verify beneficiary details before sending large transfers
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of beneficiary changes for audit purposes
5. **Security**: Limit access to beneficiary management to authorized personnel only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Beneficiary Not Found**: Ensure you're using the correct beneficiary ID
- **Invalid Account Number**: Verify the account number format is correct for the selected payment channel
- **Duplicate Beneficiaries**: Check if a beneficiary with the same details already exists
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions to manage beneficiaries
