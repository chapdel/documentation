# Authentication

<Note>
  All requests to the Notch Pay API must be authenticated. This guide explains the authentication methods available and how to implement them securely.
</Note>

<Card title="API Keys" icon="key" color="#16A34A">
  Notch Pay uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can find your API keys in your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co) under Settings > API Keys.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Test Keys">
      **Test API Keys**: Used for development and testing. These keys contain `test_` prefix.

      All transactions made with test API keys don't affect your live data and are only visible in test mode.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Live Keys">
      **Live API Keys**: Used for production environments.

      Only use these keys when your application is ready for real transactions.
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

## Authentication Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Authentication">
    For most API requests, you need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

    ```
    Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```

    ### Example Request

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL
      curl https://api.notchpay.co/payments \
        -H "Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "amount": 5000,
          "currency": "XAF",
          "customer": {
            "email": "customer@example.com"
          }
        }'
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript
      fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          amount: 5000,
          currency: 'XAF',
          customer: {
            email: 'customer@example.com'
          }
        })
      })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
      ```

      ```php PHP
      <?php
      $curl = curl_init();

      curl_setopt_array($curl, [
        CURLOPT_URL => "https://api.notchpay.co/payments",
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
        CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
          "Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
          "Content-Type: application/json"
        ],
        CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => json_encode([
          "amount" => 5000,
          "currency" => "XAF",
          "customer" => [
            "email" => "customer@example.com"
          ]
        ])
      ]);

      $response = curl_exec($curl);
      curl_close($curl);

      echo $response;
      ```

      ```python Python
      import requests
      import json

      url = "https://api.notchpay.co/payments"
      headers = {
          "Authorization": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
      payload = {
          "amount": 5000,
          "currency": "XAF",
          "customer": {
              "email": "customer@example.com"
          }
      }

      response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
      print(response.json())
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Advanced Authentication">
    <Callout type="warning">
      Some endpoints that perform sensitive operations require additional authentication beyond the standard API key. These endpoints are protected by the `GrantedMiddleware` and require a private key.
    </Callout>

    Include your private key in the `X-Grant` header:

    ```
    X-Grant: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

    <Accordion title="Endpoints Requiring Advanced Authentication">
      The following endpoints require the `X-Grant` header:

      - `/balance` - Check your account balance
      - `/transfers/*` - All transfer-related endpoints
      - `/beneficiaries/*` (or `/recipients/*`) - All beneficiary-related endpoints
      - `/webhooks/*` - All webhook-related endpoints
    </Accordion>

    ### Example Request with Advanced Authentication

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL
      curl https://api.notchpay.co/balance \
        -H "Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
        -H "X-Grant: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript
      fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/balance', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
          'X-Grant': 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
        }
      })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Sync Account Authentication">
    For operations related to synchronized accounts, you need to pass the sync account identifier in the `X-Sync` header:

    ```
    X-Sync: SYNC_ACCOUNT_ID
    ```

    <Accordion title="Operations requiring Sync Authentication">
      This is necessary when you need to perform operations on behalf of a synchronized account, such as:

      - Creating payments for a sync account
      - Viewing transactions for a sync account
      - Managing resources for a sync account
    </Accordion>

    ### Example Request with Sync Authentication

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL
      curl https://api.notchpay.co/payments \
        -H "Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
        -H "X-Sync: sync_123456789" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "amount": 5000,
          "currency": "XAF",
          "customer": {
            "email": "customer@example.com"
          }
        }'
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript
      fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
          'X-Sync': 'sync_123456789',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          amount: 5000,
          currency: 'XAF',
          customer: {
            email: 'customer@example.com'
          }
        })
      })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## API Key Security

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep API Keys Private">
    <Callout type="error">
      **Never share your API keys** in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or social media.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Whitelist Your IP Addresses">
    <Callout type="info">
      For API transfers, you must add your IP address to the whitelist in your dashboard at https://business.notchpay.co/settings/developer/ips
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Environment Variables">
    **Use environment variables** or secure vaults to store API keys in your applications.

    ```javascript
    // Example in Node.js
    const apiKey = process.env.NOTCHPAY_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Access Controls">
    **Implement proper access controls** to limit who can access your API keys.

    Only give access to team members who absolutely need it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    **Rotate your API keys** periodically, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.

    You can generate new API keys in your Notch Pay dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Test Keys for Development">
    **Use test API keys** for development and testing to avoid accidental charges.

    Switch to live keys only when you're ready to process real transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>
