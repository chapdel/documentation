# Webhooks API

<Note>
  Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events in your Notch Pay account. Instead of polling the API for updates, webhooks push data to your server when events occur.
</Note>

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook Endpoint">
    First, create an endpoint on your server that can receive HTTP POST requests. This endpoint will process webhook events from Notch Pay.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Register the Endpoint">
    Register your endpoint URL with Notch Pay through the API or dashboard. You can specify which events you want to receive.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Events">
    When an event occurs (like a payment with status "complete"), Notch Pay sends a POST request to your endpoint with event data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Process the Event">
    Your endpoint processes the event data and takes appropriate action (e.g., fulfilling an order after a payment).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Respond with 200 OK">
    Your endpoint should respond with a 200 OK status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Event Object

## Webhook Security

<Callout type="warning">
  Always verify webhook signatures to ensure they're coming from Notch Pay and not from an attacker.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve Your Webhook Secret">
    Each webhook has a secret that you can find in your dashboard or when creating a webhook via the API.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract the Signature">
    When Notch Pay sends a webhook, it includes a `X-Notch-Signature` header with a signature.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the Signature">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript Node.js
      const crypto = require('crypto');
      
      function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
        const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
        const calculatedSignature = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
        return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
          Buffer.from(calculatedSignature, 'hex'),
          Buffer.from(signature, 'hex')
        );
      }
      
      // In your webhook handler
      app.post('/webhooks', express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (req, res) => {
        const signature = req.headers['x-notch-signature'];
        const payload = req.body.toString();
        
        if (!verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, 'your_webhook_secret')) {
          return res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
        }
        
        const event = JSON.parse(payload);
        // Process the event
        
        res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
      });
      ```
      
      ```php PHP
      <?php
      function verifyWebhookSignature($payload, $signature, $secret) {
        $calculatedSignature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);
        return hash_equals($calculatedSignature, $signature);
      }
      
      // In your webhook handler
      $payload = file_get_contents('php://input');
      $signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOTCH_SIGNATURE'];
      
      if (!verifyWebhookSignature($payload, $signature, 'your_webhook_secret')) {
        http_response_code(400);
        echo 'Invalid signature';
        exit;
      }
      
      $event = json_decode($payload, true);
      // Process the event
      
      http_response_code(200);
      echo 'Webhook received';

              secret.encode('utf-8'),
              payload.encode('utf-8'),
              hashlib.sha256
          ).hexdigest()
          return hmac.compare_digest(calculated_signature, signature)

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Respond Quickly" icon="bolt" color="#16A34A">
    Respond to webhooks with a 200 status code as quickly as possible, even before processing the event. This prevents Notch Pay from retrying the webhook.
    
    Process the event asynchronously if it requires time-consuming operations.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Handle Retries" icon="rotate" color="#16A34A">
    Notch Pay will retry failed webhook deliveries several times with increasing delays. Make your webhook handler idempotent to avoid processing the same event multiple times.
    
    Store the event ID and check if you've already processed it before taking action.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor Webhook Health" icon="heart-pulse" color="#16A34A">
    Regularly check your webhook logs in the Notch Pay dashboard to ensure they're being delivered correctly.
    
    Set up monitoring for your webhook endpoint to detect and alert on failures.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock" color="#16A34A">
    Always use HTTPS for your webhook endpoints to ensure the data is encrypted in transit.
    
    Use a valid SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority.
