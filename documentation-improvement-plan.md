# Notch Pay Documentation Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a structured plan for improving the Notch Pay documentation based on the comparison with industry standards like Stripe and Flutterwave. The plan focuses on enhancing the structure, chronology, and organization of the documentation to provide a better user experience for developers and businesses.

## Current State Assessment

The current Notch Pay documentation has a solid foundation with:

- Clear sections for Getting Started, Accept Payments, Send Money, API Reference, SDKs, and Dashboard
