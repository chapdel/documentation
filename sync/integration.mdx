This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Notch Pay Sync into your platform or marketplace. Sync allows you to facilitate payments between your users, manage connected accounts, and automate payment splitting.

## Overview

Integrating Notch Pay Sync involves several key steps:

1. Setting up your platform account
2. Creating and managing connected accounts
3. Processing payments and handling fees
4. Managing transfers to connected accounts
5. Implementing webhooks for real-time updates

## Prerequisites

Before you begin integrating Sync, make sure you have:

1. A Notch Pay business account with Sync enabled
2. Access to your Notch Pay API keys
3. Completed the necessary compliance requirements
4. Basic understanding of RESTful APIs

## API Integration

### Authentication

All API requests to Notch Pay Sync require authentication using your platform's API key:

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### Creating Connected Accounts

To create a connected account for a seller or service provider on your platform:

```javascript
// Create a connected account
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/accounts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'standard', // or 'express', 'custom'
    business_profile: {
      name: 'Seller Store',
      url: 'https://sellerstore.com',
      category: 'retail'
    },
    email: 'seller@example.com',
    phone: '+237600000000',
    metadata: {
      seller_id: '12345',
      internal_reference: 'SELLER_12345'
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  const accountId = data.account.id;
  // Store the account ID for future reference
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error creating account:', error));
```

### Onboarding Connected Accounts

After creating a connected account, you need to onboard the account holder to collect their business and payment information:

```javascript
// Generate an onboarding link
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/accounts/${accountId}/onboarding`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({
    callback: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding',
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  const onboardingUrl = data.url;
  // Redirect the account holder to the onboarding URL
  window.location.href = onboardingUrl;
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error generating onboarding link:', error));
```

### Processing Payments with Automatic Splitting

To process a payment and automatically split the funds between your platform and a connected account:

```javascript
// Create a payment with automatic splitting
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 10000,
    currency: 'XAF',
    customer: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com'
    },
    description: 'Payment for Order #123',
    reference: 'order_123',
    application_fee: 1000, // Your platform fee (10%)
    destination: {
      account: accountId, // The connected account ID
      amount: 9000 // Amount to transfer to the connected account
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Redirect the customer to the payment page
  window.location.href = data.authorization_url;
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error creating payment:', error));
```

## Webhook Integration

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events related to your connected accounts, payments, and transfers.

### Setting Up Webhooks

To set up a webhook endpoint:

1. Go to your Notch Pay dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Webhooks**
3. Click **Add Endpoint**
4. Enter your endpoint URL
5. Select the events you want to receive
6. Click **Save**

### Handling Webhook Events

Here's an example of how to handle webhook events in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const crypto = require('crypto');

const app = express();

// Parse JSON request body
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Your webhook endpoint
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  const signature = req.headers['notchpay-signature'];

  // Verify the webhook signature
  const isValid = verifySignature(payload, signature, 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET');

  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  // Handle the event based on its type
  switch (payload.type) {
    case 'account.updated':
      handleAccountUpdated(payload.data);
      break;
    case 'payment.succeeded':
      handlePaymentSucceeded(payload.data);
      break;
    case 'transfer.created':
      handlePayoutCreated(payload.data);
      break;
    // Handle other event types
    default:
      console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${payload.type}`);
  }

  // Acknowledge receipt of the event
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
});

// Function to verify webhook signature
function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const expectedSignature = hmac.update(JSON.stringify(payload)).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Important Webhook Events

Here are some important webhook events to monitor:

- `account.created`: A new connected account has been created
- `account.updated`: A connected account has been updated
- `account.application.deauthorized`: A connected account has been deauthorized
- `payment.succeeded`: A payment has been successfully processed
- `payment.failed`: A payment has failed
- `transfer.created`: A new transfer has been created
- `transfer.complete`: A transfer has been paid
- `transfer.failed`: A transfer has failed

## Fee Management

Notch Pay Sync allows you to manage fees in several ways:

### Fixed Fees

Set a fixed fee amount for each transaction:

```javascript
{
  application_fee: 500, // 500 XAF fixed fee
  destination: {
    account: accountId,
    amount: 9500 // Remaining amount after fee
  }
}
```

### Percentage Fees

Take a percentage of each transaction:

```javascript
{
  application_fee_percent: 10, // 10% fee
  destination: {
    account: accountId
    // No need to specify amount, it will be calculated automatically
  }
}
```

### Combined Fees

Combine fixed and percentage fees:

```javascript
{
  application_fee: 300, // 300 XAF fixed fee
  application_fee_percent: 5, // 5% fee
  destination: {
    account: accountId
    // No need to specify amount, it will be calculated automatically
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, test your Sync integration thoroughly in the sandbox environment:

1. Use your test API keys for all API requests
2. Create test connected accounts
3. Process test payments with various payment methods
4. Test different fee structures
5. Create test transfers
6. Verify webhook delivery and handling

## Going Live

When you're ready to go live with your Sync integration:

1. Switch to your live API keys
2. Update your webhook endpoints to production URLs
3. Notify your sellers or service providers about the onboarding process
4. Monitor your first few live transactions closely
5. Set up monitoring and alerting for critical events

## Seller Dashboard Access

One of the key benefits of Notch Pay Sync is that each connected account gets access to their own dedicated Notch Pay dashboard. This provides significant advantages for both your platform and your sellers.

### Benefits for Sellers

When your sellers have access to their own Notch Pay dashboard, they can:

1. **Self-Service Account Management**: Update their business information, banking details, and notification preferences without contacting your support team
2. **Transaction Visibility**: View detailed transaction history, including payments, fees, and transfers
3. **Financial Reporting**: Access financial reports and analytics to track their business performance
4. **Dispute Management**: View and respond to payment disputes directly
5. **Verification Status**: Monitor their verification status and complete any outstanding requirements
6. **Payment Settings**: Configure their payment preferences and transfer schedules

### Benefits for Your Platform

Providing sellers with dashboard access also benefits your platform:

1. **Reduced Support Burden**: Sellers can handle many tasks themselves, reducing the need for your support team to intervene
2. **Increased Seller Satisfaction**: Sellers appreciate the transparency and control over their finances
3. **Faster Onboarding**: Sellers can complete verification steps independently
4. **Better Compliance**: Sellers can stay up-to-date with compliance requirements
5. **Scalability**: Your platform can onboard more sellers without proportionally increasing support resources

### Generating Dashboard Links

To provide a seller with access to their dashboard:

```javascript
// Generate a dashboard link
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/dashboard`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    redirect_url: 'https://your-platform.com/account/dashboard'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Redirect the seller to their dashboard
  const dashboardUrl = data.url;
  window.location.href = dashboardUrl;
})
```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Keep API Keys Secure**: Never expose your API keys in client-side code
2. **Verify Webhook Signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures to prevent fraud
3. **Implement Proper Authentication**: Secure your platform's endpoints with proper authentication
4. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for all API requests and webhook endpoints

### User Experience

1. **Streamlined Onboarding**: Make the onboarding process as simple as possible for your users
2. **Clear Fee Communication**: Clearly communicate your fee structure to your users
3. **Transparent Payouts**: Provide clear information about transfer schedules and amounts
4. **Responsive Support**: Be prepared to assist users with onboarding and payment issues
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Integrate dashboard access into your platform for a seamless experience

### Technical Implementation

1. **Idempotent Requests**: Use unique references for each payment to prevent duplicate charges
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API requests and webhooks
3. **Logging**: Keep detailed logs of all API requests and webhook events
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for critical events and error rates
