# Account Management

This guide explains how to manage connected accounts with Notch Pay Sync. Connected accounts represent the sellers, service providers, or merchants on your platform who receive payments through your platform.

## Overview

Managing connected accounts involves several key aspects:

1. Creating connected accounts
2. Onboarding account holders
3. Verifying account information
4. Monitoring account status
5. Managing account capabilities
6. Handling account updates and deactivation

## Account Types

### Standard Accounts

Standard accounts are fully-featured accounts that give account holders the most flexibility:

- Complete control over branding and customer experience
- Direct access to the Notch Pay dashboard
- Ability to manage their own payouts
- Full transaction history and reporting

Ideal for: Platforms where sellers or service providers need full control over their payment operations.

### Express Accounts

Express accounts offer a simplified onboarding process with fewer requirements:

- Streamlined onboarding (2-3 minutes)
- Limited dashboard access

- Reduced verification requirements

Ideal for: Platforms with casual sellers or service providers who need a quick onboarding process.

### Custom Accounts

Custom accounts give your platform the most control:

- Fully integrated with your platform's experience

Ideal for: Platforms that want to maintain a consistent, branded experience throughout the payment process.

## Creating Connected Accounts

### Via the Dashboard

To create a connected account through the Notch Pay dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co)
2. Navigate to **Sync** > **Connected Accounts**
3. Click **Create Account**
4. Select the account type (Standard, Express, or Custom)
5. Enter the account holder's information
6. Click **Create Account**

### Via the API

To create a connected account programmatically:

```javascript
/ Create a connected account
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'standard', / or 'express', 'custom'
    business_profile: {
      name: 'Seller Store',
      url: 'https://sellerstore.com',
      category: 'retail'
    },
    email: 'seller@example.com',
    phone: '+237600000000',
    metadata: {
      seller_id: '12345',
      internal_reference: 'SELLER_12345'
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.account.id); / The connected account ID
})
```

## Onboarding Connected Accounts

After creating a connected account, you need to onboard the account holder to collect their business and payment information. The onboarding process is a critical step that includes account setup, identity verification (KYC), and business verification.

### Seamless Account Creation and KYC Process

One of the key advantages of Notch Pay Sync is its seamless onboarding flow:

1. **Automatic Account Creation**: If a seller doesn't already have a Notch Pay merchant account, one will be automatically created for them during the onboarding process.

2. **Integrated KYC Process**: The seller can complete their Know Your Customer (KYC) verification directly within the onboarding flow, without having to leave your platform or complete separate processes.

3. **Progressive Verification**: Sellers can start with basic features and unlock more capabilities as they complete additional verification steps.

4. **Customizable Experience**: The entire process can be customized to match your platform's branding and requirements.

### The Onboarding Flow

The typical onboarding flow works as follows:

1. You create a connected account with basic information (email, phone, name)
2. You generate an onboarding link and redirect the seller to it
3. The seller completes the onboarding form, which includes:
   - Creating a Notch Pay account (if they don't have one)
   - Providing personal information
   - Uploading identity documents for KYC verification
   - Adding business details and documentation
   - Setting up payout methods (bank account or mobile money)
4. Once completed, the seller is redirected back to your platform
5. The account status is updated, and you can start processing payments for the seller

### Generating Onboarding Links

To generate an onboarding link for a connected account:

```javascript
/ Generate an onboarding link
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/onboarding`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    redirect_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/complete',
    refresh_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/refresh'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Redirect the account holder to the onboarding URL
  const onboardingUrl = data.url;
  console.log(onboardingUrl);
})
```

### Customizing the Onboarding Flow

You can customize the onboarding flow to match your platform's branding and collect specific information:

```javascript
/ Generate a customized onboarding link
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/onboarding`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    redirect_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/complete',
    refresh_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/refresh',
    branding: {
      logo: 'https://your-platform.com/logo.png',
      primary_color: '#4F46E5',
      secondary_color: '#10B981'
    },
    collect: {
      business_profile: true,
      business_type: true,
      bank_account: true,
      mobile_money: true
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  const onboardingUrl = data.url;
  console.log(onboardingUrl);
})
```

### KYC Requirements

During the onboarding process, sellers will need to provide the following for KYC verification:

1. **Personal Information**:
   - Full name
   - Date of birth
   - Residential address
   - Phone number
   - Email address

2. **Identity Verification**:
   - Government-issued ID (National ID, Passport, or Driver's License)
   - Selfie or photo verification
   - Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)

3. **Business Information** (for business accounts):
   - Business name and registration number
   - Business address
   - Business type and category
   - Business registration documents
   - Tax identification number

### Tracking Onboarding and KYC Progress

You can track the onboarding and KYC progress of a connected account:

```javascript
/ Retrieve account information
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  const requirements = data.account.requirements;
  const verification = data.account.verification;
  
  console.log('KYC Status:', verification.status);
  
  if (requirements.currently_due.length === 0) {
    console.log('All requirements met');
  } else {
    console.log('Requirements still needed:', requirements.currently_due);
  }
})
```

### Handling Incomplete Onboarding

If a seller doesn't complete the onboarding process in one session, they can resume it later:

```javascript
/ Generate a new onboarding link for an incomplete account
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/onboarding`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    redirect_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/complete',
    refresh_url: 'https://your-platform.com/onboarding/refresh'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Send the new onboarding URL to the seller
  const onboardingUrl = data.url;
  console.log(onboardingUrl);
})
```

## Verifying Connected Accounts

Connected accounts may need to go through a verification process to ensure compliance with regulations and reduce fraud risk.

### Verification Requirements

Verification requirements may include:

- Business information (name, address, registration number)
- Owner information (name, address, date of birth)
- Bank account or mobile money account details
- Identity documents (ID card, passport)
- Business documents (registration certificate, license)

### Checking Verification Status

To check the verification status of a connected account:

```javascript
/ Retrieve account information
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  const verification = data.account.verification;
  
  if (verification.status === 'verified') {
    console.log('Account is fully verified');
  } else if (verification.status === 'pending') {
    console.log('Verification is pending');
  } else if (verification.status === 'rejected') {
    console.log('Verification was rejected:', verification.reason);
  }
})
```

### Handling Verification Failures

If a connected account fails verification, you should:

1. Notify the account holder about the verification failure
2. Provide clear instructions on how to correct the issues
3. Generate a new onboarding link for them to update their information
4. Monitor the verification status after the updates

## Managing Account Capabilities

## Account Dashboard Access

Each connected account has access to their own dedicated Notch Pay dashboard. This is a powerful feature that allows your sellers or service providers to manage their own payments, view transactions, and handle their business operations independently.

### Personal Dashboard for Connected Accounts

Every connected account gets their own Notch Pay dashboard where they can:

- View and manage their transaction history
- Track incoming payments and payouts
- Update their account information and banking details
- View and respond to disputes
- Access financial reports and analytics
- Manage their verification and compliance requirements
- Set up notification preferences

This dedicated dashboard helps your platform users feel more in control of their finances while reducing your support burden.

### Dashboard Access by Account Type

#### Standard Accounts

Standard accounts have full access to the Notch Pay dashboard, where they can:

- View complete transaction history
- Manage payouts and payout schedules
- Update account and business information
- View and respond to disputes
- Access detailed financial reports and analytics
- Manage payment methods and settings

#### Express Accounts

Express accounts have streamlined access to the Notch Pay dashboard, where they can:

- View transaction history
- Update basic account information
- View payout history
- Manage essential settings

#### Custom Accounts

Custom accounts typically don't have direct dashboard access, as these are fully managed by your platform. However, you can choose to provide limited dashboard access if needed for your business model.

### Generating Dashboard Links

To generate a link for a connected account to access their dashboard:

```javascript
/ Generate dashboard link
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/dashboard`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    redirect_url: 'https://your-platform.com/account/dashboard'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Redirect the account holder to the dashboard URL
  const dashboardUrl = data.url;
  console.log(dashboardUrl);
})
```

### Embedding Dashboard Features

For a more integrated experience, you can embed certain dashboard features directly into your platform:

```javascript
/ Generate an embedded dashboard component
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/sync/accounts/${accountId}/embedded-dashboard`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PLATFORM_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    component: 'transactions', / or 'payouts', 'settings', etc.
    time_range: '30d', / Last 30 days
    branding: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#4F46E5',
        secondary: '#10B981'
      },
      hide_notchpay_logo: false
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Use the embed URL or code in your platform
  const embedUrl = data.url;
  console.log(embedUrl);
})
```
