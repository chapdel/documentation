# Fraud Detection System

Notch Pay has implemented a sophisticated fraud detection system to protect the integrity of the payment ecosystem in Africa. This system is active in both sandbox and production environments and plays a crucial role in preventing fraudulent activities.

## Our Security Approach

At Notch Pay, security is not an additional feature but a fundamental element of our platform. Our rigorous approach includes:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: All transactions are monitored in real-time to detect suspicious behaviors
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Our system continuously learns and adapts to new fraud methods
- **Manual Verifications**: Suspicious transactions may trigger manual reviews by our security team
- **Regulatory Compliance**: We adhere to all relevant financial regulations in the countries where we operate
- **Regular Security Audits**: Our systems undergo regular security assessments

## How Our Fraud Detection System Works

Our fraud detection system monitors multiple aspects of transactions and user behaviors:

### 1. Transaction Monitoring

We analyze various transaction patterns and behaviors, including:

- **Transaction Frequency**: Unusually high number of transactions in a short period
- **Transaction Amounts**: Patterns of identical amounts or unusual amount sequences
- **Recipient Concentration**: Multiple transactions to the same recipient
- **Geographic Patterns**: Unusual patterns of transactions across different regions
- **Time Patterns**: Transactions occurring at unusual times or in unusual sequences
- **Device and IP Information**: Multiple accounts using the same devices or IPs

### 2. Behavior Analysis

Our system also examines user behaviors to detect anomalies:

- **Usage Patterns**: Sudden changes in usage habits
- **Access Attempts**: Multiple failed access or payment attempts
- **Account Modifications**: Frequent or suspicious changes to account information
- **Cross-border Activities**: Unusual transactions between different countries

### 3. Identity Verification

For high-risk transactions or merchant accounts, we may implement additional verification measures:

- **KYC (Know Your Customer) Verification**: Verification of user identity
- **Business Verification**: Validation of business information for merchant accounts
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Additional protection for sensitive actions

## Risk Levels and Actions

Our system assigns risk levels to transactions and accounts, which can trigger different actions:

| Risk Level | Potential Actions |
|------------|-------------------|
| Low | Transaction processed normally with ongoing monitoring |
| Medium | Additional checks, possibility of requesting more information |
| High | Transaction put on hold for review, possibility of rejection |
| Critical | Transaction rejected, account potentially suspended for investigation |

## Common Alerts and How to Avoid Them

### Recipient Concentration

**Alert**: Multiple transactions to the same Mobile Money phone number.

**How to avoid it**:
- Distribute transactions among different recipients
- If your business model requires repeated transactions to the same recipients, contact our support team to document your use case
- Implement reasonable limits on the number of transactions to the same recipient in a given period

### Identical Transactions

**Alert**: Multiple transactions with exactly the same amounts in a short time frame.

**How to avoid it**:
- Vary transaction amounts when possible
- Space out similar transactions
- Provide detailed descriptions to justify similar transactions

### Unusual Activity

**Alert**: Sudden change in transaction habits.

**How to avoid it**:
- Gradually increase transaction volume
- Inform Notch Pay in advance if you anticipate a significant increase in activity
- Maintain consistency in your transaction habits

### Incomplete Information

**Alert**: Transactions with incomplete or suspicious customer information.

**How to avoid it**:
- Collect and transmit complete and accurate customer information
- Validate phone numbers and emails before submitting them
- Use clear and specific transaction descriptions

## Differences Between Sandbox and Production

Our fraud detection system is active in both environments, but with some important differences:

### Sandbox Environment

- Less strict parameters to facilitate testing
- Educational alerts to help developers understand risky behaviors
- No real consequences for flagged transactions

### Production Environment

- Strict parameters compliant with financial industry standards
- Real-time monitoring with possibility of manual intervention
- Real consequences for suspicious transactions, including rejection or account suspension

## Best Practices for Developers

To ensure your integrations comply with our security standards:

1. **Test Rigorously**: Use the sandbox environment to test all scenarios, including edge cases
2. **Distribute Transactions**: Avoid concentrating all transactions on a single phone number
3. **Validate Inputs**: Check and validate all user inputs before submitting them
4. **Implement Authentication**: Ensure your users are properly authenticated
5. **Monitor Activities**: Set up your own monitoring to detect suspicious behaviors
6. **Document Special Cases**: If your business model requires unusual transaction patterns, document them with our team
7. **Respect Limits**: Adhere to recommended transaction limits
8. **Update Regularly**: Keep your integration up to date with our latest security recommendations

## What to Do When a Transaction is Blocked

If a transaction is blocked by our fraud detection system:

1. **Check the Details**: Ensure all transaction information is correct
2. **Consult the Logs**: Check your application logs for any errors
3. **Contact Support**: If you believe it's a false positive, contact our support team with the transaction ID
4. **Provide Additional Information**: Be prepared to provide additional information to verify the legitimacy of the transaction
5. **Adjust Your Integration**: Modify your integration if necessary to avoid similar issues in the future

## Commitment to Continuous Improvement

Our fraud detection system is constantly evolving to address new threats. We are committed to:

- Continuously improving our detection algorithms
- Reducing false positives while maintaining robust security
- Providing clear feedback when transactions are blocked
- Working with developers to optimize their integrations
