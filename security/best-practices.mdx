# Security Best Practices

Implementing strong security practices is essential for protecting your Notch Pay account, your customers' data, and your business. This guide outlines recommended security measures and best practices to help you maintain a secure payment environment.

## Account Security

Securing your Notch Pay account is the first line of defense against unauthorized access and potential fraud.
