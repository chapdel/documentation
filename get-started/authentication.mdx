Proper authentication is essential for securing your Notch Pay integration. This guide explains the key concepts of authentication and how to get started with implementing it in your applications.

## API Keys Overview

Notch Pay uses API keys to authenticate requests to our API. When you create a Notch Pay account, you'll receive two sets of API keys:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test API Keys" icon="vial" color="#16A34A">
    Used for development and testing. These keys contain the `test_` prefix.
    
    All transactions made with test API keys don't affect your live data and are only visible in test mode.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Live API Keys" icon="rocket" color="#16A34A">
    Used for production environments. Only use these keys when your application is ready for real transactions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can find your API keys in your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co) under Settings > API Keys.

## Types of API Keys

Notch Pay provides two types of API keys for different purposes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Public Keys">
    Public keys (starting with `pk_`) are used for client-side operations that don't require access to sensitive data. These keys can be safely included in your frontend code.
    
    Example: `pk_test_123456789abcdef`
    
    **Use for**: Creating payment sessions, initializing the Notch Pay SDK in client-side code
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Private Keys">
    Private keys (starting with `sk_`) are used for server-side operations that require access to sensitive data. These keys should never be exposed in your frontend code or public repositories.
    
    Example: `sk_test_123456789abcdef`
    
    **Use for**: Accessing account information, creating transfers, managing webhooks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication Methods

Notch Pay supports several authentication methods depending on the type of operation:

### Standard Authentication

For most API requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Advanced Authentication

Some sensitive operations require additional authentication using the `X-Grant` header with your private key:

```
X-Grant: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Sync Account Authentication

When working with connected accounts, specify the account using the `X-Sync` header:

```
X-Sync: SYNC_ACCOUNT_ID
```

## API Key Security

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep Keys Secure">
    Never share your private keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or social media.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables or secure vaults, not in your application code.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement Access Controls">
    Limit who can access your API keys within your organization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Test Keys for Development">
    Always use test API keys for development and testing to avoid accidental charges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Authentication Errors

The API returns specific error codes and messages when authentication fails:

| Error | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 401 - API key missing | No API key was provided | Include your API key in the `Authorization` header |
| 401 - Invalid API key | The API key is incorrect or revoked | Check that you're using the correct API key |
| 403 - Missing grant key | Advanced authentication required | Include your private key in the `X-Grant` header |
| 403 - Invalid grant key | The private key is incorrect | Verify your private key is correct |
| 404 - Sync account not found | Invalid sync account ID | Check that the sync account exists and you have access to it |
