# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you integrate Notch Pay into your application or website quickly. We'll walk through the basic steps to accept your first payment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Notch Pay account (sign up at [business.notchpay.co](https://business.notchpay.co/register) if you don't have one)
- Your API keys (available in your dashboard under Settings > API Keys)
- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON

## Step 1: Get Your API Keys

1. Log in to your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Copy your API key (use your test key for development and testing)

```
YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Step 2: Create a Simple Payment

Let's create a basic payment using the Notch Pay API:

```javascript
/ Using fetch in JavaScript
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 5000,
    currency: 'XAF',
    customer: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      phone: '+237600000000'
    },
    description: 'Payment for Order #123',
    callback: 'https://your-website.com/callback',
    reference: 'order_123'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Redirect the customer to the payment page
  window.location.href = data.authorization_url;
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Step 3: Redirect to the Payment Page

After creating a payment, you'll receive a response with an `authorization_url`. Redirect your customer to this URL to complete the payment:

```javascript
window.location.href = data.authorization_url;
/ Example: https://pay.notchpay.co/pay_123456789
```

## Step 4: Handle the Callback

When the payment is completed (or fails), Notch Pay will redirect the customer back to your `callback` URL with the payment status:

```javascript
/ Example callback handler in Express.js
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  const reference = req.query.reference;
  
  / Verify the payment status
  fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${reference}`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    if (data.transaction.status === 'complete') {
      / Payment successful, update your database and show success page
      res.send('Payment successful!');
    } else {
      / Payment failed or is still pending
      res.send('Payment not completed.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error verifying payment');
  });
});
```

## Step 5: Set Up Webhooks (Recommended)

For more reliable payment notifications, set up webhooks to receive real-time updates about payment status changes:

1. Go to your Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks
2. Add a new webhook with your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-website.com/webhooks`)
3. Select the events you want to receive (e.g., `payment.complete`, `payment.failed`)

```javascript
/ Example webhook handler in Express.js
app.post('/webhooks', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  / Verify webhook signature (recommended for security)
  / ...
  
  / Handle different event types
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'payment.complete':
      / Update order status to paid
      break;
    case 'payment.failed':
      / Handle failed payment
      break;
    / Handle other event types
  }
  
  / Acknowledge receipt of the webhook
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
});
```
