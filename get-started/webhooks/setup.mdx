</div>

## What You'll Need

Before setting up webhooks, make sure you have:

- A Notch Pay business account
- A publicly accessible server endpoint that can receive HTTP POST requests
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON

## Creating a Webhook Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Server Endpoint">
    First, you need to create an endpoint on your server that can receive webhook notifications from Notch Pay. This endpoint should:

    - Accept HTTP POST requests
    - Parse JSON request bodies
    - Return a 2xx status code (preferably 200 OK) to acknowledge receipt

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Node.js (Express)">
        ```javascript
        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();

        // Parse JSON request bodies
        app.use(express.json());

        app.post('/webhooks/notchpay', (req, res) => {
          // Get the webhook payload
          const event = req.body;

          // Log the event type
          console.log(`Received event: ${event.type}`);

          // Process the webhook event (implement your business logic here)
          // ...

          // Return a 200 OK response
          res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
        });

        app.listen(3000, () => {
          console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
        });
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="PHP">
        ```php
        <?php
        // Get the request body
        $input = file_get_contents('php://input');
        $event = json_decode($input, true);

        // Log the event type
        error_log("Received event: {$event['type']}");

        // Process the webhook event (implement your business logic here)
        // ...

        // Return a 200 OK response
        http_response_code(200);
        echo json_encode(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Webhook received']);
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Python (Flask)">
        ```python
        from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route('/webhooks/notchpay', methods=['POST'])
        def webhook():
            # Get the webhook payload
            event = request.json

            # Log the event type
            print(f"Received event: {event['type']}")

            # Process the webhook event (implement your business logic here)
            # ...

            # Return a 200 OK response
            return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'message': 'Webhook received'}), 200

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(port=3000)
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Endpoint Publicly Accessible">
    Your webhook endpoint must be publicly accessible so that Notch Pay can send notifications to it. If you're developing locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet:

    ```bash
    # Start your local server (e.g., on port 3000)
    # Then in another terminal, run:
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    This will give you a temporary public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) that forwards to your local server. You can use this URL for testing webhooks during development.

    For production, make sure your endpoint is hosted on a reliable server with a stable URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Registering Your Webhook in Notch Pay

Once you have your endpoint ready, you need to register it with Notch Pay:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using the Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Log in to your account">
        Log in to your [Notch Pay Business account](https://business.notchpay.co/)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Navigate to Webhooks settings">
        Navigate to **Settings** > **Developers** > **Webhooks**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add a new endpoint">
        Click **Add Endpoint**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the webhook">
        Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://example.com/webhooks/notchpay` or your ngrok URL for testing)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select events">
        Select the events you want to receive notifications for
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add a description">
        Optionally, add a description to help you identify this webhook
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save the webhook">
        Click **Save** to create the webhook
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using the API">
    You can also create webhooks programmatically using the Notch Pay API:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.notchpay.co/webhooks \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "url": "https://example.com/webhooks/notchpay",
        "events": ["payment.complete", "payment.failed", "transfer.complete"],
        "description": "Payment notifications for my e-commerce site"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Selecting Webhook Events

When setting up your webhook, you can choose which events you want to receive notifications for. Here are some common event types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Payment Events">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `payment.created` | A new payment has been created |
    | `payment.complete` | A payment has been successfully completed |
    | `payment.failed` | A payment has failed |
    | `payment.canceled` | A payment has been canceled |
    | `payment.expired` | A payment has expired |
    | `payment.refunded` | A payment has been refunded |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transfer Events">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `transfer.created` | A new transfer has been created |
    | `transfer.complete` | A transfer has been successfully completed |

    | `dispute.updated` | A dispute has been updated |
    | `dispute.resolved` | A dispute has been resolved |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Securing Your Webhooks

To ensure that webhook notifications are actually coming from Notch Pay and not from a malicious third party, you should verify the signature of each webhook request:

<div className="p-6 border rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-amber-50 dark:from-yellow-900/30 dark:to-amber-900/30 mb-8">
  <div className="flex items-start">
    <div className="mr-4 text-amber-600">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z" />
      </svg>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Security Warning</h3>
      <p>Always verify webhook signatures in production environments. Failing to verify signatures could allow attackers to spoof webhook events.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

For detailed instructions on how to verify webhook signatures, see our [Verifying Webhooks](/get-started/webhooks/verify) guide.

## Testing Your Webhook

After setting up your webhook, you should test it to make sure it's working correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access webhook settings">
    In your Notch Pay dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Developers** > **Webhooks**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find your endpoint">
    Find your webhook endpoint and click the **Test** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select event type">
    Select an event type to test (e.g., `payment.complete`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send test event">
    Click **Send Test Event**
  </Step>
</Steps>

This will send a test event to your webhook endpoint. Check your server logs to make sure the event was received and processed correctly.

## Handling Webhook Failures

If Notch Pay can't deliver a webhook notification to your endpoint (e.g., if your server is down or returns a non-2xx status code), we'll retry the delivery with an exponential backoff:

- First retry: 5 minutes after the initial attempt
- Second retry: 30 minutes after the first retry
- Third retry: 2 hours after the second retry
- Fourth retry: 5 hours after the third retry
- Fifth retry: 10 hours after the fourth retry

After the fifth retry, if the webhook still can't be delivered, we'll stop trying and mark the webhook as failed.

To ensure reliable webhook delivery:

1. Make your webhook endpoint as reliable as possible
2. Return a 2xx status code as quickly as possible, even if you need to process the webhook asynchronously
3. Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhook events (in case a webhook is delivered multiple times)

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with webhooks, check the following:

1. **Endpoint Accessibility**: Make sure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and can receive HTTP POST requests.

2. **Response Code**: Ensure your endpoint returns a 2xx status code (preferably 200 OK) to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

3. **Signature Verification**: If you're verifying signatures, make sure you're using the correct webhook secret and that your verification logic is correct.

4. **Event Selection**: Verify that you've selected the appropriate event types when setting up your webhook.

5. **Server Logs**: Check your server logs for any errors or exceptions that might be occurring when processing webhook events.

6. **Webhook Dashboard**: Check the webhook logs in your Notch Pay dashboard to see if there are any delivery failures or other issues.
