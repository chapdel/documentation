2. **Wallet Selection**: The customer selects their digital wallet from the available options
3. **Authentication**: The customer logs in to their wallet or follows the wallet's authentication process

5. **Confirmation**: Notch Pay confirms the payment status and notifies your application

  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Redirect to checkout where digital wallets will be an option
  window.location.href = data.authorization_url;
})
```

## USSD Payments

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) payments allow customers to pay using their mobile phones without requiring internet access. This is particularly useful in areas with limited internet connectivity.

### How USSD Payments Work

1. **Initialize Payment**: Create a payment with customer and transaction details
2. **USSD Code Generation**: Notch Pay generates a USSD code for the payment
3. **Customer Dialing**: The customer dials the USSD code on their phone
4. **Authentication**: The customer follows the prompts to authenticate and authorize the payment
5. **Confirmation**: Notch Pay confirms the payment status and notifies your application

### Supported USSD Services

Notch Pay supports USSD payments through various mobile operators:

- MTN USSD
- Orange USSD
- Other local operators depending on the country

### Integration Example

```javascript
/ Create a payment
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 5000,
    currency: 'XAF',
    customer: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      phone: '+237600000000'
    },
    description: 'Payment for Order #123',
    reference: 'order_123'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Process with USSD
  fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${data.transaction.reference}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      channel: 'cm.mtn.ussd',
      data: {
        phone: '+237600000000'
      }
    })
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(ussdData => {
    / Display USSD code to customer
    console.log(`Dial ${ussdData.ussd_code} to complete payment`);
  })
})
```

## QR Code Payments

QR code payments allow customers to pay by scanning a QR code with their mobile banking or payment app. This method is becoming increasingly popular due to its convenience and contactless nature.

### How QR Code Payments Work

1. **Initialize Payment**: Create a payment with customer and transaction details
2. **QR Code Generation**: Notch Pay generates a QR code for the payment
3. **Customer Scanning**: The customer scans the QR code with their mobile app
4. **Authentication**: The customer authorizes the payment in their app
5. **Confirmation**: Notch Pay confirms the payment status and notifies your application

### Supported QR Code Standards

Notch Pay supports various QR code payment standards depending on the region:

- EMVCo QR Code

### Integration Example

```javascript
/ Create a payment
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 5000,
    currency: 'XAF',
    customer: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com'
    },
    description: 'Payment for Order #123',
    reference: 'order_123'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  / Process with QR Code
  fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${data.transaction.reference}/qrcode`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
    }
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(qrData => {
    / Display QR code to customer
    document.getElementById('qrcode-container').innerHTML = `<img src="${qrData.qr_code_url}" alt="Scan to pay">`;
  })
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Offer Multiple Payment Methods**: Provide customers with various payment options to increase conversion rates
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions for each payment method, especially for methods that require additional steps
3. **Handle Timeouts**: Some payment methods may take longer to complete, so implement proper timeout handling
4. **Implement Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications when payment statuses change
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all payment methods in the sandbox environment before going live

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Bank Transfer Delays**: Bank transfers may take longer to process, especially during non-business hours
- **USSD Network Issues**: USSD payments may fail due to mobile network issues
- **QR Code Scanning Problems**: Ensure QR codes are displayed clearly and with sufficient size
- **Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations**: Be aware that cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate during the payment process
