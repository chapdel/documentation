## Processing Refunds

### From the Dashboard

The easiest way to process a refund is through your Notch Pay dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co)
2. Go to **Payments** > **Refunds**
3. Find the payment you want to refund
4. Click the **Refund** button
5. Enter the refund amount (for partial refunds) or select **Full Refund**
6. Add a reason for the refund (optional)
7. Click **Process Refund**

### Using the API

You can also process refunds programmatically using the API:

```javascript
/ Process a refund
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/refunds', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    payment: 'pay_123456789', / Payment ID or reference
    amount: 5000, / For partial refunds (in the smallest currency unit)
    / Omit amount for full refunds
    reason: 'Customer requested cancellation',
    metadata: { / Optional
      order_id: '12345',
      customer_service_rep: 'jane_doe'
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.refund.id); / The refund ID
  console.log(data.refund.status); / The refund status
})
```

## Refund Types

### Full Refunds

A full refund returns the entire payment amount to the customer:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/refunds', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    payment: 'pay_123456789',
    reason: 'Product returned'
  })
})
```

### Partial Refunds

A partial refund returns only a portion of the payment:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/refunds', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    payment: 'pay_123456789',
    amount: 2500, / Refund half of a 5000 payment
    reason: 'Partial order cancellation'
  })
})
```

## Refund Statuses

Refunds can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| pending | The refund has been initiated but not yet processed |
| processing | The refund is being processed by the payment provider |
| complete | The refund has been successfully processed |
| failed | The refund could not be processed |

## Retrieving Refunds

### Retrieving a Single Refund

To retrieve information about a specific refund:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/refunds/ref_123456789', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.refund);
})
```

### Listing Refunds for a Payment

To retrieve all refunds for a specific payment:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments/pay_123456789/refunds', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.refunds);
})
```

### Listing All Refunds

To retrieve all refunds for your account:

  headers: {

  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.refunds);
})
```

## Refund Webhooks

To receive notifications about refund events, set up webhooks for the following events:

- `refund.created`: A refund has been created
- `refund.complete`: A refund has been successfully processed
- `refund.failed`: A refund has failed

Example webhook payload for a refund event:

```json
{
  "type": "refund.succeeded",
  "data": {
    "id": "ref_123456789",
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "XAF",
    "payment": "pay_123456789",
    "reason": "Customer requested cancellation",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "order_id": "12345",
      "customer_service_rep": "jane_doe"
    }
  }
}
```

## Refund Limitations

When processing refunds, be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Time Limits**: Refunds can typically be processed within 90 days of the original payment
2. **Payment Method Restrictions**: Some payment methods may have restrictions on refunds
3. **Processing Time**: Refunds may take several days to process, depending on the payment method
4. **Fees**: While Notch Pay doesn't charge additional fees for refunds, the original processing fees are typically not refunded

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Refund Policy**: Establish a clear refund policy for your customers
2. **Prompt Processing**: Process refunds promptly to maintain customer satisfaction
3. **Detailed Records**: Keep detailed records of refund reasons for reconciliation
4. **Communication**: Keep customers informed about the status of their refunds
5. **Partial Refunds**: Consider offering partial refunds when appropriate
6. **Metadata**: Use metadata to link refunds to your internal systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure your Notch Pay account has sufficient funds to process the refund
- **Invalid Payment**: Verify that the payment ID or reference is correct
- **Payment Not Eligible**: Check that the payment is in a state that allows refunds
- **Amount Exceeds Payment**: Ensure the refund amount doesn't exceed the original payment amount
