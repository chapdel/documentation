# Introduction to Mobile Money

Mobile Money is one of the most popular payment methods in Africa, allowing customers to pay using their mobile phone accounts. With over 500 million registered accounts across the continent, Mobile Money has revolutionized financial inclusion and digital payments in regions with limited banking infrastructure.

## What is Mobile Money?

Mobile Money is a service that allows users to store, send, and receive money using their mobile phones. Unlike traditional banking, Mobile Money doesn't require a bank account, making it accessible to the unbanked population. Users can deposit cash at agent locations and convert it to digital currency stored in their mobile wallet.

<Note>
    Mobile Money has a **higher adoption rate** than credit cards in many African countries, making it essential for
    businesses targeting African markets.
</Note>

## Why Choose Mobile Money for Your Business?

- **Wide Reach**: Access millions of customers who primarily use Mobile Money
- **High Success Rates**: Typically 85-95% success rates for properly formatted transactions
- **Lower Fees**: Often more cost-effective than card payments
- **Instant Confirmation**: Real-time payment notifications
- **Reduced Fraud**: Two-factor authentication built into the payment flow

## How Mobile Money Payments Work

<img src="/images/mobile-money-flow.png" alt="Mobile Money Payment Flow" />

The Mobile Money payment flow with Notch Pay works as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Payment">
    Create a payment with customer and transaction details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Enters Phone Number">
    The customer enters their Mobile Money phone number
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Request">
    Notch Pay sends a payment request to the Mobile Money provider
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Confirmation">
    The customer receives a prompt on their phone to confirm the payment (USSD or app-based)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    The Mobile Money provider processes the payment (typically 5-30 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Notch Pay confirms the payment status and notifies your application via webhook
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Options

We offer multiple ways to integrate Mobile Money payments into your application, from no-code solutions to fully customizable API implementations.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Collect (No-Code)">
        The simplest way to accept Mobile Money payments is through [Notch Pay Collect](/accept-payments/collect). This
        hosted payment page requires no coding and handles the entire payment flow.

        ### Benefits of Using Collect
        - **Quick Setup**: Integrate in minutes with minimal code
        - **Optimized UX**: Mobile-responsive design with localized interfaces
        - **Automatic Updates**: Always up-to-date with the latest features
        - **Reduced PCI Scope**: Security handled by Notch Pay

        ### How to Implement
        ```javascript
        // Create a payment session
        fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/checkout/sessions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
        body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'XAF',
        payment_methods: ['mobile_money'], // Limit to Mobile Money only
        success_url: 'https://your-website.com/success',
        cancel_url: 'https://your-website.com/cancel'
    })
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
        // Redirect customer to the checkout page
        window.location.href = data.checkout_url;
    });
        ```

        [//]: # ({/*<Frame>)

[//]: # (  <img src="/images/screenshots/mobile-money-collect.png" alt="Mobile Money on Collect Payment Page" />)

[//]: # (</Frame>*/})
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Direct API Integration">
        For more control over the payment flow, you can use the Notch Pay API to process Mobile Money payments directly:

        ### Complete Integration Flow

        #### 1. Initialize a Payment

        ```javascript
        // Create a payment
        fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
        body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'XAF',
        customer: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john@example.com',
        phone: '+237600000000'
    },
        description: 'Payment for Order #123',
        reference: 'order_123',
        metadata: {
        order_id: '123',
        product_name: 'Premium Subscription'
    }
    })
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
        // Store the payment reference for the next step
        const paymentReference = data.payment.reference;
    })
        ```

        #### 2. Process the Payment with Mobile Money

        ```javascript
        // Process the payment with Mobile Money
        fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${paymentReference}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
        body: JSON.stringify({
        channel: 'cm.mtn', // or 'cm.orange' for Orange Money
        data: {
        phone: '+237680000000' // Customer's Mobile Money phone number
    }
    })
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
        // Payment is now processing
        // The customer will receive a prompt on their phone

        // Store transaction ID for status checks
        const transactionId = data.payment.id;
    })
        ```

        #### 3. Verify the Payment Status

        ```javascript
        // Check the payment status
        fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${paymentReference}`, {
        headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
    }
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
        if (data.transaction.status === 'complete') {
        // Payment successful
        // Update your database and fulfill the order
    } else if (data.transaction.status === 'failed') {
        // Payment failed
        // Show error message to customer
    } else {
        // Payment still processing
        // Show waiting message to customer
    }
    })
        ```

        <Tip>
            For production environments, we strongly recommend using webhooks instead of polling for payment status
            updates. See our [Webhooks Guide](/get-started/webhooks) for implementation details.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="SDK Integration">
        Our SDKs provide a simplified way to integrate Mobile Money payments with pre-built components and helper
        methods.

        ### JavaScript SDK

        ```javascript
        // Initialize Notch Pay
        const notchpay = new NotchPay('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');

        // Create a payment
        notchpay.createPayment({
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'XAF',
        customer: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john@example.com',
        phone: '+237600000000'
    },
        description: 'Payment for Order #123'
    })
        .then(payment => {
        // Process with Mobile Money
        return notchpay.processMobileMoney(payment.reference, {
        provider: 'mtn', // or 'orange', 'airtel', etc.
        country: 'cm',   // country code
        phone: '+237680000000'
    });
    })
        .then(result => {
        console.log('Payment initiated:', result);
        // The customer will receive a prompt on their phone
    })
        .catch(error => {
        console.error('Payment error:', error);
    });
        ```

        For more SDK examples, see our [SDK Documentation](/sdks).
