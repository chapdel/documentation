## How Mobile Money Payments Work

The Mobile Money payment flow with Notch Pay works as follows:

1. **Initialize Payment**: Create a payment with customer and transaction details
2. **Customer Enters Phone Number**: The customer enters their Mobile Money phone number
3. **Payment Request**: Notch Pay sends a payment request to the Mobile Money provider
4. **Customer Confirmation**: The customer receives a prompt on their phone to confirm the payment
5. **Payment Processing**: The Mobile Money provider processes the payment
6. **Confirmation**: Notch Pay confirms the payment status and notifies your application

## Integration Options

### Using Collect

The simplest way to accept Mobile Money payments is through [Notch Pay Collect](/accept-payments/collect). When creating a payment, the customer will be presented with Mobile Money as a payment option.

### Direct API Integration

For more control over the payment flow, you can use the Notch Pay API to process Mobile Money payments directly:

#### 1. Initialize a Payment

```javascript
// Create a payment
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 5000,
    currency: 'XAF',
    customer: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      phone: '+237600000000'
    },
    description: 'Payment for Order #123',
    reference: 'order_123'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Store the payment reference for the next step
  const paymentReference = data.transaction.reference;
})
```

#### 2. Process the Payment with Mobile Money

```javascript
// Process the payment with Mobile Money
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${paymentReference}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    channel: 'cm.mtn', // or 'cm.orange' for Orange Money
    data: {
      phone: '+237680000000' // Customer's Mobile Money phone number
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Payment is now processing
  // The customer will receive a prompt on their phone
})
```

#### 3. Verify the Payment Status

```javascript
// Check the payment status
fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${paymentReference}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.transaction.status === 'complete') {
    // Payment successful
  } else if (data.transaction.status === 'failed') {
    // Payment failed
  } else {
    // Payment still processing
  }
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Phone Numbers**: Ensure that the phone number is in the correct format for the selected Mobile Money provider
2. **Handle Timeouts**: Mobile Money payments may take some time to complete, especially if the customer delays confirming the payment
3. **Implement Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications when the payment status changes
4. **Provide Clear Instructions**: Guide your customers on how to complete the payment on their mobile phones
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Use test credentials to simulate different payment scenarios before going live

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Invalid Phone Number**: Ensure the phone number is in the correct international format (e.g., +237XXXXXXXXX)
- **Insufficient Funds**: The customer may not have enough funds in their Mobile Money account
- **Transaction Timeout**: The customer may not have confirmed the payment within the allowed time
- **Network Issues**: Mobile network problems can affect the payment process
