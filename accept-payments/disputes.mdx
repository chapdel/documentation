## The Dispute Process

The dispute process typically follows these steps:

1. **Dispute Filed**: A customer files a dispute with their payment provider
2. **Notification**: Notch Pay notifies you of the dispute
3. **Response**: You submit evidence to respond to the dispute
4. **Review**: The payment provider reviews the evidence
5. **Resolution**: The dispute is resolved in favor of either the customer or the merchant
6. **Funds Settlement**: Funds are settled based on the resolution

## Managing Disputes

### From the Dashboard

The easiest way to manage disputes is through your Notch Pay dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Notch Pay Business suite](https://business.notchpay.co)
2. Go to **Payments** > **Disputes**
3. You'll see a list of all disputes with their status
4. Click on a dispute to view details and respond

### Using the API

You can also manage disputes programmatically using the API:

#### Retrieving Disputes

```javascript
/ List all disputes
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/disputes', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.disputes);
})

/ Retrieve a specific dispute
fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/disputes/dp_123456789', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.dispute);
})
```

```

## Evidence Types

When responding to a dispute, you can submit various types of evidence:

- **Customer Information**: Name, email, billing address
- **Product/Service Details**: Description, delivery date, proof of delivery
- **Communication Records**: Customer correspondence, service agreements

## Preventing Disputes

Implement these best practices to reduce the likelihood of disputes:

1. **Clear Business Name**: Ensure your business name on statements matches your customer-facing name
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide clear product/service descriptions
3. **Transparent Policies**: Make your refund and cancellation policies easily accessible
4. **Responsive Support**: Address customer concerns promptly
5. **Delivery Confirmation**: Use trackable shipping methods
6. **Documentation**: Keep records of customer communications and transactions

These fees vary depending on the payment method and country. Check your Notch Pay dashboard for specific fee information.

## Best Practices
