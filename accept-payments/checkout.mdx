## Standard Checkout Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Payment">
    Use the [Payments API](/api-reference/payments) to initialize a payment:

    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.notchpay.co/payments', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'XAF',
        customer: {
          email: 'customer@example.com'
        },
        callback: 'https://example.com/callback',
        reference: 'order_123'
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const checkoutUrl = data.authorization_url;
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Redirect to Checkout">
    Redirect your customer to the checkout URL:

    ```javascript
    window.location.href = checkoutUrl;
    ```

    Or use a button:

    ```html
    <a href="{{checkoutUrl}}" class="button">Pay Now</a>
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle the Callback">
    After the payment is completed, the customer will be redirected to your callback URL with the payment reference:

    ```
    https://example.com/callback?reference=order_123
    ```

    Verify the payment status using the [Retrieve a Payment](/api-reference/payments#retrieve-a-payment) endpoint:

    ```javascript
    app.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
      const { reference } = req.query;
      
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.notchpay.co/payments/${reference}`, {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
      });
      
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (data.transaction.status === 'complete') {
        // Payment complete, fulfill the order
        // ...
        res.send('Payment complete!');
      } else {
        // Payment not complete
        res.send('Payment not completed.');
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Embedded Checkout Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Include the Notch Pay JS SDK">
    Add the Notch Pay JavaScript SDK to your page:

    ```html
    <script src="https://js.notchpay.co/v1/inline.js"></script>
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Payment">
    Use the [Payments API](/api-reference/payments) to initialize a payment as in the standard checkout.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize the Embedded Checkout">
    ```javascript
    const checkout = NotchPay.initializeCheckout({
      paymentId: data.transaction.id,
      onSuccess: function(transaction) {
        // Payment complete
        console.log('Payment successful:', transaction);
        // Redirect or show success message
        window.location.href = '/success?reference=' + transaction.reference;
      },
      onError: function(error) {
        // Payment failed
        console.error('Payment failed:', error);
        // Show error message
      },
      onClose: function() {
        // User closed the checkout
        console.log('Checkout closed');
      }
    });

    // Open the checkout
    checkout.open();
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing the Checkout

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Customization">
    You can customize the appearance of the checkout by passing additional parameters when creating the payment:

    ```javascript
    const payment = {
      // Basic payment details
      amount: 5000,
      currency: 'XAF',
      customer: {
        email: 'customer@example.com'
      },
      
      // Customization options
      title: 'Payment for Order #123',
      description: 'Your order from Example Store',
      logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png',
      color: '#4F46E5',
      
      // Other parameters
      callback: 'https://example.com/callback',
      reference: 'order_123'
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Advanced Customization">
    For embedded checkout, you can apply additional customization:

    ```javascript
    const checkout = NotchPay.initializeCheckout({
      paymentId: data.transaction.id,
      
      // Callbacks
      onSuccess: function(transaction) { /* ... */ },
      onError: function(error) { /* ... */ },
      onClose: function() { /* ... */ },
      
      // Advanced customization
      theme: {
        logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png',
        primaryColor: '#4F46E5',
        backgroundColor: '#F9FAFB',
        textColor: '#1F2937',
        borderRadius: '8px',
        fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif'
      },
      
      // Display options
      displayMode: 'popup', // 'popup' or 'inline'
      container: '#checkout-container', // Required for inline mode
      locale: 'en', // 'en' or 'fr'
      
      // Payment method options
      preferredChannels: ['cm.mtn', 'cm.orange'], // Show these channels first
      excludedChannels: ['cm.card'] // Hide these channels
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing the Checkout

<Callout type="info">
  You can test the checkout using our test credentials. See the [Testing Guide](/testing) for more information.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Test Mode">
    Make sure you're using your test API key that starts with `test_`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Test Payment">
    Create a payment as usual, but use test customer information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Test Payment Methods">
    When testing, you can use the following test payment methods:
    
    - **Mobile Money**: Use the phone number `+237600000000` for successful payments
    - **Cards**: Use the test card number `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Webhooks">
    Test webhooks are also sent for test payments, allowing you to verify your webhook handling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Webhooks" icon="bell" color="#16A34A">
    Don't rely solely on the callback URL for payment confirmation. Set up [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) to receive real-time payment notifications.
    
    This ensures you don't miss any payment updates, even if the customer closes their browser after payment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify Payment Status" icon="check-double" color="#16A34A">
    Always verify the payment status server-side before fulfilling orders.
    
    Never trust client-side confirmations alone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provide Clear Information" icon="circle-info" color="#16A34A">
    Include detailed product information, order details, and your business name in the payment.
    
    This helps customers recognize the payment on their statements and reduces disputes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handle Errors Gracefully" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#16A34A">
    Implement proper error handling for cases where the customer abandons the checkout or encounters payment failures.
    
    Provide clear instructions for customers to retry payments if needed.
  </Card>
